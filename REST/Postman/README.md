# Example REST Calls for Postman

The JSON file contains example REST calls that can be used with the Postman tools [link to Postman website]. To use the file you'll need to import it into Postman. Once imported you'll also need to edit the server, username, and password files to fit your system. You may also need to import the server hostca.crt certificate file if you want to securely connect to the server and it doesn't have a registered certificate.

## [to do] 
- Add info on how to import JSON file
- Add info on how to set server, username, and password variables
- Add info on how to get and replace rad_reference numbers
- Discuss using log on v1 vs v2 and how to use calls beyond then
